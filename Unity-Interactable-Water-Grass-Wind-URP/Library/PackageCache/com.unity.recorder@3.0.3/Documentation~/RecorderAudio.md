# Audio Recorder properties

The **Audio Recorder** generates an audio clip in WAV format.

This page covers all properties specific to the Audio Recorder type.

> **Note:** To fully configure any Recorder, you must also set the general recording properties according to the recording interface you are using: the [Recorder window](RecorderWindowRecordingProperties.md) or a [Recorder Clip](RecordingTimelineTrack.md#recorder-clip-properties).
