# ![Freeze Transform icon](images/icons/Freeze_Transform.png) Freeze Transform

The __Freeze Transform__ tool sets the selected object's position, rotation, and scale to world-relative origin (**{0,0,0}**) without changing any vertex positions. That means it resets the pivot location and clears all Transform values, but doesn't change the size, shape, or location of the object in the Scene.
