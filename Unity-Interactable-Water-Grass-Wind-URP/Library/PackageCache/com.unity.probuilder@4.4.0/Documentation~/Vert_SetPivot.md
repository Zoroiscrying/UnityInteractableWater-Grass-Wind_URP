In this example:
* **Left panel**: The pivot point of the log is at the end corner of the cylinder. 
* **Middle panel**: The vertices on the end are selected, so the Set Pivot tool changes the pivot to the center of those end vertices. 
* **Right panel**: The pivot point is now in the center of the cylinder end, even when in Object editing mode.
