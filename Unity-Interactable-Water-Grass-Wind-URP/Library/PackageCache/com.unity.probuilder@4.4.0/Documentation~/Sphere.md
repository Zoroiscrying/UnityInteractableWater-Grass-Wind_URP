# Sphere
A sphere is a perfectly round 3D object. In ProBuilder, a sphere is actually a polygon with 42 vertices, in which five triangles (faces) share each vertex.

![A](images/LetterCircle_A.png) Sphere shape with no subdivisions showing five triangles colored. A wireframe of a default sphere is superimposed on that shape (the same radius but with one subdivision).

![B](images/LetterCircle_B.png) Default sphere shape (one subdivision).

![C](images/LetterCircle_C.png) Sphere with two subdivisions.

![D](images/LetterCircle_D.png) Sphere with three subdivisions.

![E](images/LetterCircle_E.png) Sphere with four subdivisions.

You can customize the shape of a sphere with these shape properties:

| **Property:** | **Description:** |
|:-- |:-- |
| __Radius__ | Set the radius (size) of the sphere in meters. The default value is 1. Valid values range from 0.01 to 10. |
| __Subdivisions__ | Set the number of times to subdivide each triangle. The default value is 1. Valid values range from 0 to 4.<br /><br />The more subdivisions you create, the smoother the sphere appears. However, remember that each subdivision increases the number of triangles exponentially, which means that it uses a lot more resources to render. |
