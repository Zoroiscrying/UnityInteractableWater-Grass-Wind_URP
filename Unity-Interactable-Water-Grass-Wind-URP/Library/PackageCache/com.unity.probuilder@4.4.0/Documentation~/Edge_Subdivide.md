# ![Subdivide Edge icon](images/icons/Edge_Subdivide.png) Subdivide Edge

The __Subdivide Edge__ tool divides the selected edge(s) into multiple edges. By default, ProBuilder splits the edge in two, but you can set your own number of __Subdivisions__ in the Options window.

> **Tip:** You can also use this tool with the **Alt/Opt+S** hotkey.

## Subdivide Edge Options

To change the number of new edges created, change the __Subdivisions__ option. By default, the number of subdivisions is **1**, which means that ProBuilder splits a single selected edge into two edges. If you change this value to **3**, then a single edge becomes four edges. 

The range of valid values is **1** to **32**.
