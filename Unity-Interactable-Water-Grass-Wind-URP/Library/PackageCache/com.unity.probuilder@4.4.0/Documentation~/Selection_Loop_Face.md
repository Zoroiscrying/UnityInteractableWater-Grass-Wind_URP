# ![Select Face Loop icon](images/icons/Selection_Loop_Face.png) Select Face Loop

The __Select Face Loop__ selects a face loop from each selected face. 

ProBuilder only considers faces part of a loop if they are quads (contain exactly four sides). Face loops generally run along the Z-axis, while [face rings](Selection_Loop_Ring.md) generally run along the X-axis.

This tool is only available in [face mode](modes.md). 

> ***Tip:*** You can also use this tool with the **Opt/Alt+Shift+L+Double-Click** hotkey, or from the ProBuilder menu (**Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Selection** > **Select Loop**).
