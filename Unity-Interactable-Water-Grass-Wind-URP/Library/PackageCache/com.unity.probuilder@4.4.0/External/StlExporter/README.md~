# pb_Stl

An STL importer/exporter for Unity.

**pb_Stl** is the exporter used in ProBuilder to save [STL](http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/stl/) model files.

## Quick Start

1. Select a `GameObject` in the Scene View with a `MeshFilter` and valid `Mesh`.
1. In the file menu,  `Edit > Export > STL (Ascii)`.
1. View your shiny new STL file.

## Features

- Export and import Binary & ASCII STL files in editor or at runtime.
- Custom AssetPostProcessor automatically creates usable prefabs from any STL imported to Unity.
- Option to convert from left to right handed coordinates (on by default, as per STL spec).
- Automatic merging of multiple selected meshes, including relative transformations.
- Import models with vertex counts larger than Unity max by automatically splitting into multiple meshes.

## Planned Improvements

- Export window with additional options:
    - Swap model axis on import/export.
    - Export as multiple objects or merge (currently always merges).
    - Generate normals on import (with smoothing or no).
    
## Troubleshooting

#### Model is sideways / horizontal / rotated

Unity's coordinate system is left handed, with Y axis as the vertical.  Other 3d modeling programs may have different coordinate systems or axis assignments.  **pb_Stl** exports right handed coordinates by default, but can be modified to retain left handed coordinates.  Support for swapping axes is planned.
