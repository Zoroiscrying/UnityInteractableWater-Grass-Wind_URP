## About

ProBuilder is a 3D modeling plugin for [Unity](https://unity3d.com).

This readme is intended as a brief introduction for developers interested in working with the API.

See the [Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.probuilder@4.0/manual/index.html) for a user guide, or the [Scripting Reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.probuilder@4.0/api/index.html) for API documentation.

## Development

ProBuilder is a developed as a package and distributed with Package Manager.

The simplest way to get started working with source is to clone the repository into your `Packages` directory.

```
~/Desktop/MyProject$ cd Packages/
~/Desktop/MyProject/Packages$ git clone https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.probuilder
```

See the [Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@2.0/manual/index.html#installing-removing-disabling-and-updating-packages) documentation for more information on installing packages.

## API

There are 3 major namespaces.

| Namespace | Function |
|--|--|
| `UnityEngine.ProBuilder` | Mesh types and functions to compile meshes to Unity compatible assets. |
| `UnityEngine.ProBuilder.MeshOperations` | Mesh editing. |
| `UnityEditor.ProBuilder` | Editor integration. |

Mesh data is stored in a component (`ProBuilderMesh`) and compiled to a `UnityEngine.Mesh` (referred to as `UMesh` from here on) as necessary.

`ProBuilderMesh` retains the following mesh information:

- Positions
- UVs
- Faces
	- Triangles
	- Material
	- Smoothing group
	- Auto/Manual UVs*
- Tangent (if user set)
- UV3/4 (if user set)
- Colors
- Shared vertices (also referred to as "common vertices")

Normals, tangents, collisions, and UVs are calculated as necessary.

\*ProBuilder can automatically UV unwrap triangles on a per-face basis. `Face`
has a toggle to enable or disable this feature (users are free to unwrap faces
by manually as well).

Modifying a ProBuilder mesh is a bit different from a Unity mesh. Instead of
working with the `MeshFilter.sharedMesh` you'll instead be operating on the
ProBuilder representation of the mesh: `ProBuilderMesh`.

A typical workflow looks like this:

```
// Create a new cube primitive
var mesh = ShapeGenerator.CreateShape(ShapeType.Cube);

// Extrude the first available face along it's normal direction by 1 meter.
mesh.Extrude(new Face[] { mesh.faces.First() }, ExtrudeMethod.FaceNormal, 1f);

// Apply the changes back to the `MeshFilter.sharedMesh`.
// 1. ToMesh cleans the UnityEngine.Mesh and assigns vertices and sub-meshes.
// 2. Refresh rebuilds generated mesh data, ie UVs, Tangents, Normals, etc.
// 3. (Optional, Editor only) Optimize merges coincident vertices, and rebuilds lightmap UVs.
mesh.ToMesh();
mesh.Refresh();
mesh.Optimize();
```
